# Random things learned from the cpp projects

# CPP 00
namespace:

gruping related declarations(functions, variables etc) together under a single name
to prevent collisions if different libraries are using the same names for their variables
or functions etc.

class:

a class is a user-defined type that encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data.
The data and functions are combined into a single unit, and objects can be created from the class
to represent instances of that unit.

private:

can be accessed only inside of the class

public:

can be accessed from anywhere, even from outside of the class

constructor:
initialize the data members of the object, either way to default values or initialize to the passed
parameters in the constructor. Has the same name as the class and no return type

destructor:
called when the the object is being destroyed and it frees up everything what should been freed. It
takes no arguments neither returns anything

ex00:
simple function to convert the input into uppercase and return it.

ex01:
creating a phonebook where you can:

add new contacts up to 8

search for contacts and

exit

ex 02:

here you need to recreate the account file based on the test and the way you can do it will be similiar the way to create the phonebook, but of course a bit different.
